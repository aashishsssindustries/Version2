Phased Implementation Plan
1. Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline a staged implementation approach for the proposed system. The aim is to deliver the product incrementally, validate assumptions to stakeholders at an early stage, and add revenue-generating features much later when the core functionality is stabilized.
2. Implementation Strategy Overview
The implementation is divided into three phase
Phase 1: Basic Implementation
Phase 2: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Phase 3: Revenue Generation
3. Phase 1 – Basic Implementation
3.1 Objective
The objective of Phase 1 is to develop a basic working version of the system that covers the basic user journey and confirm end-to-end data flow.
3.2 Scope
3.2.1 User Onboarding and Profiling
