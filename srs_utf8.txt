ClientX: Comprehensive Software Requirements Specification (SRS) v1.20
1. Executive Scope
ClientX is a web-based fintech platform designed to function as an automated financial advisor. It guides users from data profiling to solution execution (insurance, mutual funds, options trading, etc.).
Core Value Proposition: A "Financial Health Score" gamification engine and a unique "Option Wealth" module allowing 80% LTV margin against pledged assets.
2. User Actors & Journeys
The system must support three distinct logic paths based on user personas:
Persona A (Early Career): Focus on SIPs, Tax Saving, and simple goal planning.
Path: Onboarding → Aptitude Survey → SIP Execution.
Persona B (Mid-Career/High Income): Focus on risk management and active trading.
Path: Liability capture → Portfolio Pledging → Option Wealth Trial.
Persona C (HNI/Retiring): Focus on capital preservation.
Path: Net Worth Analysis → Retirement Planning → Income Solutions.
3. Functional Modules
3.1 Intelligent Profiling Engine
Persona A (25–35, ₹6–18 LPA): Focuses on savings, SIPs, and future goals; values simplicity and low-cost guidance. Journey: Onboarding → Profiling → SIP/retirement suggestions → Advisory report → Start SIP.
Persona B (35–50, ₹20–60 LPA): Seeks tax optimization, diversification, and risk control with detailed tools. Journey: Deep profiling → Margin pledge → Option Wealth trial → Advisory report.
Persona C (50+): Asset-heavy, prioritizes preservation, income, and estate planning. Journey: Net-worth analysis → Retirement tools → Insurance/income solutions.

Objective: Create a visual "Financial Persona" and compare against the 30-30-30-10 Rule.
Data Ingestion:
Mandatory: Name, Email (OTP verified), Mobile (OTP verified), PAN (10-char alphanumeric validation).
Financials: Gross Income, Fixed Expenses, Liabilities (EMI), Existing Assets.
Logic:
Validate PAN format and income ranges.
Compute user distribution: Expenditure vs. Liabilities vs. Investment vs. Emergency Fund.
Gap Analysis: Compare user ratios against the Ideal Rule (30% Exp, 30% Liab, 30% Inv, 10% Emergency).
Output: Interactive Persona Card (SVG) highlighting deviation from the ideal model.
3.2 Investment Aptitude Survey
Objective: Psychometric profiling to determine Risk Class.
Mechanism: 25-question dynamic form.
Scoring: Weighted responses (1-5 scale) normalized to a 0-100 score.
Bucketing Logic:
0–33: Conservative
34–66: Moderate
67–100: Aggressive
Guardrails: Logic must detect contradictions (e.g., "High Risk" preference but "Low Loss" tolerance) and default to the lower risk category.
3.3 Financial Health Score (Gamification)
Objective: A real-time composite score (0-100) to drive user engagement.
Algorithm Weights:
Savings Rate (20%): (Investments + Emergency Fund) / Income.
Debt Ratio (20%): Total EMI / Income (Must punish >40%).
Liquidity (15%): Emergency Fund / Monthly Expenses (Target: 6 months).
Diversity (15%): Asset allocation spread.
Goal Preparedness (15%): Funded status of declared goals.
Literacy (15%): Survey score normalization.
UI Requirement: Display percentile ranking against "Top Investors" and "Projected Score" if recommendations are followed.
3.4 Automated Problem Identification
The logic engine must auto-detect and flag specific financial risks:
Emergency Shortfall: Liquidity < 3 months.
Debt Trap: DTI Ratio > 40%.
Under-insured: Life cover < (Income $\times$ 10) + Liabilities.
Output: Ranked list of "Action Items" with estimated financial impact.


4. Calculator Suite Specifications
All calculators must support graphical output (Highcharts/Recharts) and PDF export.

5. Option Wealth Module (Special Feature)
Objective: Provide options trading leverage backed by portfolio collateral.
5.1 Eligibility & Pledge
Input: User selects Mutual Fund/Equity holdings from portfolio.
Valuation: Real-time API fetch of NAV/Price.

Risk Engine (Critical):
Monitor Margin Utilization in real-time.
Trigger: If Utilization > 90% LTV → Issue Warning.
Trigger: If Utilization > 100% LTV → Auto-Liquidation of positions.
6. Reporting Module
System must generate a white-labeled PDF advisory report.
Technology: Headless browser (Puppeteer/Playwright) for HTML-to-PDF rendering.
